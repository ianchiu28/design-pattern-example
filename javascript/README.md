## Introduction

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They provide a way to solve problems efficiently by following proven best practices. This repository aims to provide examples and explanations of different design patterns to help developers understand and apply them in their own projects.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing ways to create objects in a manner suitable for a particular situation. Examples of creational patterns include:

- [Singleton](creational/singleton.js)
- [Factory Method](creational/factoryMethod.js)
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition, providing ways to organize objects to form larger structures. Examples of structural patterns include:

- Adapter
- Decorator
- Proxy
- Composite
- Facade

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, providing ways to define how objects interact and distribute responsibilities. Examples of behavioral patterns include:

- Observer
- Strategy
- Command
- Iterator
- Template Method
